# 👋 Hi, I’m Swapnil

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m passionate about building intelligent systems combining computer vision, machine learning, and software development to solve real problems.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- Develop **multimodal AI** systems — e.g. chatbots that work with both images and text  
- Build **face recognition** and computer vision pipelines  
- Work with full-stack & backend technologies, databases (MySQL), and integrate AI models  
- Constantly learning new frameworks, tools, and exploring new domains

---

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

### **Lawlease – AI Chatbot with Image Analysis**  
A legal assistant that processes both user text and uploaded images (e.g. contract scans, legal documents), fusing OCR / vision outputs with NLP to provide contextually accurate legal guidance.

### **FaceRecog**  
A face recognition system using OpenCV and MySQL that can register and detect faces in real time, storing metadata and enabling identity verification through camera feeds or images.

## 🧩 Tech Stack & Tools

| Area | Tools / Libraries |
|------|-------------------|
| Computer Vision | OpenCV, PIL, image processing |
| Machine Learning / AI | (add frameworks you use, e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn) |
| Backend / DB | MySQL (using mysql.h, connectors), REST APIs |
| Languages | C++, Python, (add others) |
| Dev / Deployment | Git, Linux, Docker, (any cloud or CI/CD you use) |

## 🎯 Goals & Growth

- Expand Lawlease into a production-ready legal AI assistant  
- Build more secure, scalable systems with stronger model integration  
- Contribute to open source AI & computer vision projects  
- Collaborate with others who share interest in multimodal AI / computer vision
