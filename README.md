## ðŸš€ What I Do

- Develop **multimodal AI** systems â€” e.g. chatbots that work with both images and text  
- Build **face recognition** and computer vision pipelines  
- Work with full-stack & backend technologies, databases (MySQL), and integrate AI models  
- Constantly learning new frameworks, tools, and exploring new domains

## ðŸ§© Tech Stack & Tools

| Area | Tools / Libraries |
|------|-------------------|
| Computer Vision | OpenCV, PIL, image processing |
| Machine Learning / AI | (add frameworks you use, e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn) |
| Backend / DB | MySQL (using mysql.h, connectors), REST APIs |
| Languages | C++, Python, (add others) |
| Dev / Deployment | Git, Linux, Docker, (any cloud or CI/CD you use) |
